//
// The task of this module is to allow communications between eNodeBs via the X2 interface.
// It acts as a bridge between the X2 user modules and the X2Apps that are responsible 
// for communication with the X2Apps on the peering eNodeBs. 
// If you want to implement a new module that needs to exploit the X2 interface, you must
// connect the module to the dataPort gate of the LteX2Manager.
