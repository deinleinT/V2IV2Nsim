//
// IP2Nic module performs as a bridge between the IP network layer and the LTE/NR protocol stack
// It has a slightly different behavior in the UE rather than in the BS
// It basically:
// - Registers itself as an interface for being accessible from upper layers (e.g. IP Layer)
// - In the downstream direction adds control information to IP packets (5-tuple). Moreover in the BS 
//   module it adds the destination id to the control information, in order to send packets to the correct UE  
//
simple IP2Nic like INetworkLayer2CellularNic
