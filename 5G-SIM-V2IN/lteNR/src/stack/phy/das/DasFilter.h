 * @class DasFilter
 * @brief Class containing all infos to handle DAS
 *
 * This is the DAS filter, performing the following tasks:
 * - Report Set handling (for LteFeedback).
 * - Remote Antenna Set Physical Properties (for LtePhy)
 *
 * It is only present on eNodeB and UEs thereby attached,
 * performing these tasks:
 * - eNodeB:
 *   - Stores the Remote Antenna Set (provided by the cellInfo at startup)
 * - On UEs attached to eNodeBs:
 *   - Retrieves the Remote Antenna Set from the master
 *   - Reads broadcast packet to find out which Antennas
 *     he can be associated with (the Reporting Set)
 *
 * The "Reporting set" generation is made by checking if
 * the rssi for a given Antenna is above a certain threshold
