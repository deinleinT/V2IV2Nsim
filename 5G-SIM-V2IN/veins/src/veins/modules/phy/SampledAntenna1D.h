/**
 * @brief
 * This class represents an antenna whose gain is calculated from given samples in the horizontal plane.
 * The respective gain is therefore dependent on the azimuth angle.
 * The user has to provide the samples, which are assumed to be distributed equidistantly.
 * As the power is assumed to be relative to an isotropic radiator, the values have to be given in dBi.
 * The values are stored in a mapping automatically supporting linear interpolation between samples.
 * Optional randomness in terms of sample offsets and antenna rotation is supported.
 *
 * * An example antenna.xml for this Antenna can be the following:
 * @verbatim
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <root>
        <Antenna type="SampledAntenna1D" id="antenna1">
            <!-- Write the samples in the value attribute, separated by spaces. The values will be -->
            <!-- distributed equidistantly, e.g. 4 values will be placed at 0째, 90째, 180째 and 270째 -->
            <parameter name="samples" type="string" value="3 -3 3 -3"/>

            <!-- Options for random offsets are as follows. -->
            <!-- The mean of the given distribution has to be 0 (so that the overall offset is close to 0dBi) -->
            <!-- <parameter name="random-offsets" type="string" value="uniform a b"/> -->
            <!-- <parameter name="random-offsets" type="string" value="normal mean stddev"/> -->
            <!-- <parameter name="random-offsets" type="string" value="triang a b c"/> -->
            <parameter name="random-offsets" type="string" value="uniform -0.01 0.01"/>

            <!-- Options for random rotation of the antennas are the same, but mean doesn't have to be 0. -->
            <parameter name="random-rotation" type="string" value="uniform -1 1"/>
        </Antenna>
